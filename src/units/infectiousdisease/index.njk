The Infectious Diseases Unit at the University of Malaya Medical Centre provides care for patients with infections ranging from complicated infections and tropical infections to undifferentiated fever, people living with HIV, and key affected populations. 
We also have an antimicrobial stewardship team that works together closely with our pharmacists and microbiologists to help ensure the appropriate use of antibiotics within the hospital. The team believes in practicing evidence-based medicine and is active 
in research covering dengue infections, multidrug-resistant bacteria, antimicrobial resistance, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antibiotics, Tuberculosis, COVID-19, and HIV (prevention, aging, mental health, womenâ€™s health, and stigma).
