## PACTALS 2023

The Clinical Neurophysiology and Neuromuscular Section (CNNS) of the Malaysian Society of Neurosciences (MSN) is pleased to host the forthcoming 3rd International Pan-Asian Consortium for Treatment and Research in ALS (PACTALS) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from 14-16th September 2023.

The Congress is organised with remarkable support from key opinion leaders in ALS from the region. We are also fortunate to receive support from the International Alliance of ALS/MND Organisations and our local patient advocacy group, MND Malaysia.

PACTALS 2023 aims to provide attendees with the latest in scientific and clinical knowledge in ALS as well as increase disease awareness and collaborative network amongst the regional community. Our programme will include plenary talks, workshops and scientific symposiums, featuring international and regional speakers.

We are confident that PACTALS 2023, set against the backdrop of our vibrant city of Kuala Lumpur, will provide delegates with a rewarding and memorable experience.

We look forward to welcoming you to Kuala Lumpur in 2023.
