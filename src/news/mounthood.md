## Overview

 

The next Mount Hood challenge meeting will be hosted by the Department of Medicine, University of Malaya. It will take place 4th and 5th of December in conjunction with Society for Medical Decision Making meeting at Connexion Conference & Event Center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 

 

As with past Mt Hood challenge meetings, the aim of the conference is to promote the use of health economics and diabetes simulation models with a special focus on the development and use of simulation models within Asia. First first day of the meeting will be devoted to diabetes simulation modelling and will include an Asian-focused simulation modelling challenge. The second day will have a broader focus and abstract and panel sessions covering all aspects of health economics as well as aspects of medical decision-making such as risk communication, the process for submitting abstracts is outlined here. This will be one of the first physical health economics conferences in Asia after the pandemic and will give delegates a chance to strengthen networks and be exposed to a wide range of new developments in both health economics and simulation modelling. 

 

The meeting will include a combination of:

- set Mt Hood style challenges are that undertaken by groups who have developed simulation models;

- presentations by groups simulation models or undertaking related health economic work;

- abstract sessions covering health economics, simulation modelling and decision science. 


 

Those attending the conference will be able to attend the conference dinner on Monday 4th December. 

Virtual training workshops and masterclasses will be held on Sunday 3rd of December 2023.
